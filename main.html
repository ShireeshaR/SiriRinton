    <p class="main-cont6">How can this website end without my love lines for you baby?? That's why I'm writing..Don't feel bored and read completely.</p>
    <p class="main-cont7">As I said in the beginnig of this page, You are the most wonderful thing happened to me in my life baby..and best part of my life.! I can say this without any doubt. From the starting day onwards my life is full of happiness with you. Ofcourse, there are some days with sad, but those are just temporary baby..At the end of the day we can't stay without talking to each other. May be that might be the best thing of our relationship. I want us to be like this till our life ends baby. I want to grow old with you..till I cant walk anymore..!! I want to stay with you till the END of my life..till my last breath. I wish, I was there right beside you when you were reading this and I wish I could see your expressions..and a sweet smile in your face, And give a tight bear hug!! But this stupid corona is not letting it happen, we should beat it's ass up..ugh!! But It's okay, I know we will meet soon and we will be back to our world soon..‚ù§Ô∏è Right now if there is anyone for whom I can do anything without even a doubt means that's only YOU baby...!!ONLY YOU...!! I LOVE YOU BABY üòò </p>
